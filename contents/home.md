#### Research Programs
- **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project**  
  *Title: Research on Holstein Cattle Image Recognition Based on Spectral Graph Theory and Elastic Net Sparse Representation*  
  Participated in the project as a core member, focusing on algorithmic aspects of **clustering analysis** and **anomaly detection** applied to large-scale image data.  
  - Designed and optimized algorithms using **graph-based clustering** and **density-based methods**, extending the project scope from cattle image recognition to more general data mining and pattern recognition tasks.  
  - This research was further extended into independent studies, resulting in multiple publications in international journals and conferences.
