*Title: Research on Holstein Cattle Image Recognition Based on Spectral Graph Theory and Elastic Net Sparse Representation*

Participated as a core member, focusing on algorithmic aspects of **clustering analysis** and **anomaly detection** applied to large-scale image data.

**Highlights**
- Designed and optimized **graph-based clustering** and **density-based** methods.
- Extended the scope from cattle image recognition to general data mining and pattern recognition tasks.
- Led extensions that resulted in multiple publications in international journals and conferences.
